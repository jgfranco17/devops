## User stories

### Project setup

_As a developer_
_I want to run a predefined task from my config file_
_So that I can quickly execute repeatable workflows_

### Environment management

_As a DevOps engineer_
_I want to define environment variables per task in the config file_
_So that I can run tasks with the correct configuration without polluting my global environment_

### Configuration validation

_As a DevOps engineer_
_I want to validate my config file before running tasks_
_So that I can catch errors early and avoid unexpected failures_

### Observability

_As a developer_
_I want to control logging verbosity with flags_
_So that I can troubleshoot issues when tasks fail_

### Error handling

_As a developer_
_I want the CLI to return the correct exit code based on task execution_
_So that I can integrate into scripts and CI/CD pipelines_

## Non-functional requirements

- The CLI should capture and propagate exit codes of executed commands
- Error messages should be human-readable and provide actionable hints
- The CLI should not execute arbitrary code beyond what is explicitly defined in the YAML file
